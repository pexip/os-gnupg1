Description: GNU privacy guard - a PGP implementation (deprecated "classic" version)
 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.
 It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant
 with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC 4880.
 .
 The gnupg1 package provides GnuPG 1.4, the "classic" standalone,
 non-modularized version. It is provided mainly for people with the
 need to use archaic cryptographic objects like PGPv3 keys to access
 archived messages.  It does not support more recent cryptographic
 primitives like ECDSA or EdDSA.  Please use the gnupg package instead
 unless you know for sure that you need gnupg1.

Description: GNU privacy guard - signature verification tool (deprecated "classic" version)
 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 .
 gpgv is a stripped-down version of gnupg which is only able to check
 signatures.  It is smaller than the full-blown gnupg and uses a
 different (and simpler) way to check that the public keys used to
 make the signature are trustworthy.
 .
 gpgv1 is the "classic" version of gpgv. It does not support as many
 cryptographic primitives as the modern version, so there are
 signatures it cannot verify.  Please use the "gpgv" package instead
 where possible.
